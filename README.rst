Modified dwave-neal

Modification Notice
-------------

This is a modification of dwave-neal package from D-Wave System's https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-neal.
External one-hot constraint, which means that in some group of variables, only one of them can have value one, is implemented into the annealing algorithm.
Variable pruning, that is reducing the number of variables in the problem before submitting it into the annealing algorithm, can also be implemented more easily by this modified package.
The modified files are the following:
- neal/sampler.py
- neal/simulated_annealing.pyx
- neal/src/cpu_sa.cpp
- neal/src/cpu_sa.h

Please also chech the installation section to install this package. Note that it will overwrite the original dwave-neal.

Introduction
-------------

An implementation of a simulated annealing sampler.

A simulated annealing sampler can be used for approximate Boltzmann sampling or
heuristic optimization. This implementation approaches the equilibrium
distribution by performing updates at a sequence of increasing beta values,
``beta_schedule``, terminating at the target beta. Each spin is updated once
in a fixed order per point in the beta_schedule according to a Metropolis-
Hastings update. When beta is large the target distribution concentrates, at
equilibrium, over ground states of the model. Samples are guaranteed to match
the equilibrium for long 'smooth' beta schedules.

For more information, see Kirkpatrick, S.; Gelatt Jr, C. D.; Vecchi, M. P.
(1983). "Optimization by Simulated Annealing". Science. 220 (4598): 671â€“680

Example Usage
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    import neal

    sampler = neal.SimulatedAnnealingSampler()

    h = {0: -1, 1: -1}
    J = {(0, 1): -1}
    sampleset = sampler.sample_ising(h, J)
